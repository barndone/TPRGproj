# Tactics RPG Project  

## About

This project is a part of a class assessment for building out an NPC for a game or simulation. In this case, the project is implementing two different pathfinding algorithms and a decision making algorithm to build an NPC opponent for a turn-based Tactics RPG. This opponent will control a party of units with different behaviors depending on their class.

For the purposes of the assessment, this project has implemented:
>The A* Pathfinding Algorithm (calculates the actual path the unit takes)  
>Dijkstra's (Modified to show the accessible tiles of a unit)  
>Decision Trees (controls how the AI will move their party)  

This project will support any version of **Unity 2020.3** or newer.
